# Kitchen Restaurant Game - L0 Operations Example

## Overview

This example demonstrates how BUSY Language can model real-time operational processes (L0) with a game-like user interface. The kitchen management system treats the dinner service workflow as an interactive, visual experience where staff can drag-and-drop orders, monitor cooking progress with visual timers, and coordinate complex multi-station operations.

## Game-Like UI Concepts

### 1. **Kitchen Overview Board** (Expeditor View)
- **Visual Layout**: Top-down view of kitchen stations
- **Drag & Drop**: Assign order items to stations by dragging tickets
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Green: On schedule
  - Yellow: Attention needed
  - Red: Behind/urgent
- **Live Timers**: Countdown clocks on each active dish
- **Heat Map**: Shows station utilization and bottlenecks

### 2. **Cooking Simulator Interface** (Line Cook View)
- **Station Dashboard**: Your assigned station with active orders
- **Visual Timers**: Circular progress indicators for each dish
- **Temperature Gauges**: Real-time temp monitoring with target zones
- **Recipe Cards**: Quick-access overlays with cooking instructions
- **Coordination Panel**: See other stations' progress for timing

### 3. **Order Flow Pipeline** (Manager View)
- **Kanban-Style Board**: Orders flow through stages
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time KPIs
  - Average ticket time
  - Station efficiency
  - Quality scores
  - Remake rates
- **Predictive Alerts**: AI-powered bottleneck predictions
- **Resource Meters**: Ingredient levels, staff capacity

### 4. **Quality Control Interface** (QC Station)
- **Inspection Checklist**: Visual checkmarks for each quality point
- **Photo Comparison**: Side-by-side with standard presentation
- **Temperature Scanner**: Click to check temps
- **Remake Button**: One-click to send back with notes

## Key Features Demonstrated

### Real-Time Coordination
- Multiple users working simultaneously
- Live updates across all interfaces
- WebSocket-based state synchronization

### Gamification Elements
- **Score System**: Quality points, speed bonuses
- **Achievements**: "Perfect Service", "Rush Hour Hero"
- **Leaderboards**: Daily/weekly performance metrics
- **Skill Progression**: Track improvement over time

### Visual Feedback
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions between states
- **Sound Cues**: Audio alerts for critical events
- **Haptic Feedback**: Tablet vibration for urgent alerts
- **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of all timed activities

### Flexible Overrides
- **Rush Mode**: Skip non-critical steps during peak times
- **Manual Override**: Take control of any automated process
- **Emergency Protocols**: One-button activation for common issues
- **Undo/Redo**: Full history with rollback capability

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
interface KitchenState {
  stations: Map<StationId, StationState>;
  orders: Map<OrderId, OrderState>;
  inventory: InventoryState;
  metrics: RealTimeMetrics;
}

interface StationState {
  id: string;
  type: 'grill' | 'saute' | 'salad' | 'dessert';
  capacity: number;
  activeItems: CookingItem[];
  cook: UserId;
  efficiency: number;
}

interface CookingItem {
  orderId: string;
  dishId: string;
  startTime: Date;
  targetTime: Date;
  temperature: number;
  status: 'prep' | 'cooking' | 'resting' | 'plating';
  quality: number;
}
```

### UI Components
- **React**: For dynamic UI updates
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations
- **D3.js**: Real-time data visualizations
- **Socket.io**: Live state synchronization
- **React DnD**: Drag and drop functionality

### Game Engine Features
- **Physics**: Realistic timing constraints
- **Collision Detection**: Prevent overloading stations
- **Pathfinding**: Optimal order routing
- **State Machines**: Complex cooking state transitions

## Getting Started

1. **Validate the BUSY file**:
   ```bash
   busy-check validate ./kitchen-operations.busy
   ```

2. **Generate the framework**:
   ```bash
   busy-check generate-framework ./kitchen-operations.busy -o ./generated/
   ```

3. **Generate the runtime UI**:
   ```bash
   busy-check generate-runtime ./kitchen-operations.busy -o ./kitchen-app/
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   cd kitchen-app/
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Customization Ideas

### Additional Stations
- Pastry station with proofing timers
- Bar with cocktail recipes
- Sushi bar with freshness tracking

### Advanced Features
- Predictive ordering based on patterns
- Automated inventory reordering
- Staff scheduling optimization
- Customer wait time predictions

### Integration Points
- POS system connection
- Inventory management system
- Staff scheduling software
- Customer feedback system

## Learning Outcomes
