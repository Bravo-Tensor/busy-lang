# The Marketplace Vision: An App Store for Business Expertise

## The Big Idea

**"Excel for Business Processes" + "App Store for Business Expertise"**

Just as Excel revolutionized how businesses model data, and app stores democratized software distribution, we're creating a marketplace that democratizes access to business expertise through executable workflows.
