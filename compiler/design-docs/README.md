# Design Documents

This folder contains design documents for iterative improvements to the BUSY language compiler project. Each major revision follows a structured process of analysis, design, and implementation planning.

## Migration-Style Organization

Design documents are organized in sequential, numbered folders similar to database migrations. This creates a clear chronological record of the project's evolution and makes it easy to track changes over time.

### Folder Structure

### Naming Convention
- **Folders**: `{###}-{short-description}/` (e.g., `001-specification-changes/`)
- **Numbers**: Zero-padded 3-digit sequential numbers
- **Descriptions**: Kebab-case, concise description of the main focus

## Design Process

Our design process follows these steps:
1. **Requirements Analysis** - Understand the changes needed
2. **Impact Assessment** - Analyze effects on existing systems
3. **Design Documentation** - Create comprehensive design specifications
4. **Implementation Planning** - Break down work into actionable tasks
5. **Review & Approval** - Stakeholder review before implementation

## Document Types

### Iteration README
- **Purpose**: Overview and metadata for each design iteration
- **Location**: `{###}-{description}/README.md`
- **Content**: Summary, status, timeline, success criteria

### Design Documents
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive architectural and specification changes
- **Format**: `*_DESIGN.md`
- **Content**: Requirements, current state analysis, proposed changes, impact assessment

### Implementation Task Breakdowns
- **Purpose**: Detailed, actionable implementation plans
- **Format**: `*_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md` or `IMPLEMENTATION_*.md`
- **Content**: Phase breakdown, specific tasks, dependencies, timelines

## Current Design Iterations

### 001: BUSY Specification Changes (2025-07-16)
**Status**: Proposed  
**Type**: Major Specification Changes  

- **[001-specification-changes/](./001-specification-changes/)** - Complete design iteration
- **Focus**: Capability-based imports, document definitions, hierarchical tasks
- **Impact**: High - Breaking changes requiring comprehensive updates

## Guidelines for Future Design Documents

### Naming Convention
- Design documents: `{FEATURE_NAME}_DESIGN.md`
- Implementation plans: `{FEATURE_NAME}_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- Use UPPER_CASE with underscores for clarity

### Required Sections
All design documents should include:
1. **Executive Summary** - High-level overview
2. **Current State Analysis** - What exists today and its issues
3. **Proposed Changes** - Detailed specification of changes
4. **Implementation Impact** - Effects on existing systems
5. **Risk Assessment** - Potential risks and mitigation
6. **Implementation Plan** - High-level approach

All implementation documents should include:
1. **Phase Breakdown** - Logical phases with dependencies
2. **Detailed Tasks** - Specific, actionable tasks
3. **Success Criteria** - How to measure completion
4. **Timeline Estimates** - Realistic time projections
5. **Risk Mitigation** - Plans for handling issues

### Quality Standards
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects of the change
- **Actionable**: Provide clear implementation guidance
- **Reviewable**: Enable effective stakeholder review
- **Maintainable**: Easy to update as requirements evolve

## Usage Notes

- Design documents are living documents during the design phase
- Once approved, they become historical records
- Implementation details may evolve, but core design decisions should remain stable
- All design documents should be reviewed before implementation begins

This folder serves as both an active workspace for current designs and a historical archive of how the project has evolved over time.
