# {###}: {Design Iteration Name}

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status**: Proposed | In Review | Approved | Implemented | Rejected  
**Type**: Major | Minor | Patch | Experimental  

## Overview

Brief description of the design iteration and its primary goals.

## Changes Included

1. **Change 1** - Brief description
2. **Change 2** - Brief description
3. **Change 3** - Brief description

## Documents

- **[{FEATURE_NAME}_DESIGN.md](./{FEATURE_NAME}_DESIGN.md)** - Complete design specification
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md)** - Detailed implementation plan
- Additional supporting documents as needed

## Impact Assessment

### Complexity Level
**Low | Medium | High** - Description of implementation complexity

**Affected Systems**:
- [ ] JSON Schema
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Semantic Analysis
- [ ] Symbol Table
- [ ] Example Files
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Tests

### Breaking Changes
**Yes | No** - Description of breaking changes and migration requirements

### Timeline Estimate
**X-Y days** across N implementation phases:
1. Phase 1 Description (X days)
2. Phase 2 Description (Y days)
3. Additional phases as needed

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Core implementation complete
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Example files updated
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Migration tools created (if needed)

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- List any previous design iterations that must be completed first
- External dependencies or requirements

### Blocks
- List any design iterations that depend on this one

## Migration Strategy

For breaking changes:
1. **Automated Migration**: Description of automated tooling
2. **Manual Steps**: Required manual intervention
3. **Validation**: How to verify successful migration
4. **Rollback Plan**: How to revert if needed

## Next Steps

1. **Review Process** - Stakeholder review requirements
2. **Approval Criteria** - What needs approval to proceed
3. **Implementation Start** - When implementation can begin
4. **Validation Gates** - Quality gates during implementation

## Design Decisions Record

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Decision 1**: Rationale and alternatives considered
- **Decision 2**: Rationale and alternatives considered

### Alternative Approaches Considered
- **Alternative 1**: Why it was not chosen
- **Alternative 2**: Why it was not chosen

### Deferred Decisions
- **Deferred 1**: Why decision was deferred and when it will be revisited
