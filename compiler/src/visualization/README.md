- ✅ Accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

### 🎨 Visual Design System

#### **Color-Coded Node Types**
- 🔵 **Organizations** - Blue (`#2563eb`)
- 🟣 **Teams** - Purple (`#7c3aed`) 
- 🟢 **Roles** - Green (`#059669`)
- 🔴 **Playbooks** - Red (`#dc2626`)

#### **Edge Types & Styling**
- **Solid lines** - Hierarchy relationships
- **Dashed lines** - Dependencies
- **Arrows** - Directional relationships
- **Highlighting** - Connected elements on selection

### 📈 Mock Data Structure

The demo visualizes a realistic **Solo Photography Business** with:

```
Solo Photography Business (Organization)
├── Client Operations (Team)
│   ├── Inquiry Manager (Role)
│   ├── Project Coordinator (Role)
│   └── Client Onboarding (Playbook)
├── Creative Production (Team)
│   ├── Photographer (Role)
│   ├── Photo Editor (Role)  
│   └── Photo Production (Playbook)
└── Business Operations (Team)
    ├── Financial Manager (Role)
    ├── Contract Admin (Role)
    └── Monthly Financials (Playbook)
```

With **dependency flows**: Client Onboarding → Photo Production → Monthly Financials

## 🚀 How to Experience the Visualization

### **Option 1: Run the Demo Server** (Recommended)
```bash
cd compiler
npm run viz:demo
# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

### **Option 2: Direct HTML File**
```bash
cd compiler/src/visualization
open demo.html  # macOS
# or drag demo.html to your browser
```

### **Option 3: Integration with Real BUSY Files**
The system is designed to work with actual BUSY files from the `examples/` directory. The analyzer can parse real organizational structures.

## 🎯 Key Features Demonstrated

### **1. Organizational Overview**
- Hierarchical layout showing org → teams → roles
- Clear visual hierarchy with appropriate spacing
- Organization as central node with teams radiating outward

### **2. Dependency Visualization** 
- Shows workflow dependencies between playbooks
- Dashed lines indicate process flow
- Helps identify bottlenecks and critical paths

### **3. Interactive Exploration**
- **Selection**: Click any node to highlight connected elements
- **Hover**: Instant information display
- **Zoom**: Mouse wheel or touch gestures for navigation
- **View Modes**: Switch between different visualization perspectives

### **4. Performance & Scalability**
- Efficient rendering with D3.js
- Smooth animations and interactions
- Prepared for large organizational structures
