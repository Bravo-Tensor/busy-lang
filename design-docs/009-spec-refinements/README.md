# BUSY Specification Refinements

## Overview

This design implements three major refinements to the BUSY specification that transform it from a mixed-concern language into a pure business process specification language.

## Key Changes

### 1. Capability/Responsibility Model
- All roles, tools, and advisors must specify capabilities (interface definitions)
- Capabilities enable plug-and-play composability
- Responsibilities are elevated capabilities for continuous monitoring
- Creates foundation for "capability marketplace"

### 2. Runtime Execution Strategy  
- Remove execution_type (human/ai_agent/algorithmic) from spec
- Generate all three execution types, runtime handles switching
- Fallback chain: algo → AI → human with override capability
- Execution strategy becomes runtime configuration, not spec concern

### 3. Resource Management Abstraction
- Remove explicit resource allocation from spec
- Runtime handles all resource management (like memory in high-level languages)
- Resources only specified as interface requirements
- BYO resources supported through interface compatibility

## Benefits

- **Cleaner Specification**: BUSY focuses purely on business logic
- **Runtime Flexibility**: Execution and resources adapt without spec changes
- **True Composability**: Interface-driven architecture enables component reuse
- **Graceful Degradation**: Built-in fallbacks for execution and resources
- **Fractal Architecture**: Patterns apply recursively across layers

## Implementation

See [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for detailed 7-week implementation roadmap.

## Migration

Existing BUSY files will be automatically migrated with tooling support. The changes are largely subtractive (removing fields) with the capability model being the main addition.
