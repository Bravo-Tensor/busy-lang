# BUSY Language Design Documentation

This directory contains the complete design documentation for the BUSY Language project - a domain-specific language for describing business organizations as code.

## Project Overview

The BUSY ecosystem consists of four main components:

1. **BUSY Language** - YAML-based DSL for describing business processes
2. **BUSY Compiler** - Transforms .busy files into executable components  
3. **Orgata Runtime** - Business process execution engine and IDE
4. **OSTEAOS** - Operating system providing resource isolation and governance

## Documentation Organization

Design documents are organized using a migration-style approach with sequential numbering to track the project's evolution chronologically.

### Current Design Documents

#### 001: Initial BUSY Language Specification (2024-2025)
**Status**: Implemented  
**Type**: Core Language Design  

- **[001-initial-specification/](./001-initial-specification/)** - Original BUSY language design
- **Focus**: Core grammar, architecture concepts, product requirements
- **Impact**: Foundation for entire BUSY ecosystem

#### 002: Runtime Architecture (2025)
**Status**: Implemented  
**Type**: System Architecture  

- **[002-runtime-architecture/](./002-runtime-architecture/)** - Runtime system design
- **Focus**: Orgata runtime, layer-first architecture, resource management
- **Impact**: Defines execution model and runtime behavior

#### 003: Compiler Implementation (2025)
**Status**: Implemented  
**Type**: Implementation Plan  

- **[003-compiler-implementation/](./003-compiler-implementation/)** - Compiler design and implementation
- **Focus**: TypeScript compiler, analysis engine, validation rules
- **Impact**: Enables BUSY language tooling and development workflow

#### 004: Specification Changes (2025-07-16)
**Status**: Proposed  
**Type**: Major Specification Updates  

- **[004-specification-changes/](./004-specification-changes/)** - Enhanced language features
- **Focus**: Capability-based imports, document definitions, hierarchical tasks
- **Impact**: Breaking changes requiring comprehensive updates

## Quick Navigation

### Core Architecture
- **[ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](./ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md)** - Complete system architecture
- **Layer-First Architecture**: L0 (Operational), L1 (Management), L2 (Strategic)
- **Runtime Isolation**: Each layer runs in separate Orgata instances

### Language Reference
- **Grammar**: YAML-based syntax with business domain concepts
- **Types**: Roles, playbooks, tasks, deliverables, resources
- **Validation**: Real-time analysis and business rule enforcement

### Implementation Status
- âœ… **Core Language**: Grammar and parsing complete
- âœ… **Compiler**: Full validation and analysis engine
- âœ… **Runtime Generator**: React/Next.js application generation
- âœ… **Process Execution**: Comprehensive workflow orchestration
- ðŸ”„ **Specification Updates**: Enhanced features proposed

## Design Process

Our design process follows these phases:
1. **Requirements Analysis** - Understand business and technical needs
2. **Impact Assessment** - Analyze effects on existing systems
3. **Design Documentation** - Create comprehensive specifications
4. **Implementation Planning** - Break down work into actionable tasks
5. **Review & Approval** - Stakeholder review before implementation
6. **Migration Execution** - Implement changes with proper versioning

## Document Standards

### Naming Convention
- **Folders**: `{###}-{short-description}/` (e.g., `001-initial-specification/`)
- **Numbers**: Zero-padded 3-digit sequential numbers
- **Descriptions**: Kebab-case, concise description of main focus
- **Files**: `{FEATURE_NAME}_DESIGN.md` or `{FEATURE_NAME}_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### Required Sections
All design documents include:
- **Executive Summary** - High-level overview and goals
- **Current State Analysis** - Existing state and identified issues
- **Proposed Changes** - Detailed specification of modifications
- **Implementation Impact** - Effects on existing systems and users
- **Risk Assessment** - Potential risks and mitigation strategies
- **Implementation Plan** - High-level approach and phases

## Future Roadmap

Planned design iterations include:
- **005**: Performance optimization and scalability improvements
- **006**: Enhanced IDE integration and developer experience
- **007**: Enterprise features and governance capabilities
- **008**: Advanced analytics and business intelligence

## Contributing

When creating new design documents:
1. Use the next sequential number in the series
2. Follow the template in `_template/`
3. Include comprehensive impact analysis
4. Plan implementation in actionable phases
5. Get stakeholder review before implementation

This documentation serves as both active workspace for current designs and historical archive of project evolution.
