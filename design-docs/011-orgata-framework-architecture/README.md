# 011: Orgata Framework Architecture

**Date**: 2025-01-29  
**Status**: In Design  
**Type**: Runtime Framework Architecture  

## Overview

This design iteration defines the comprehensive framework architecture for Orgata, the runtime execution engine for BUSY language specifications. 

## Design Focus

- Core framework classes and interfaces for runtime execution
- Process orchestration and state management
- Human-AI collaboration patterns
- Resource management (time, people, capital, attention)
- Exception handling with governance integration
- Layer isolation enforcement (L0/L1/L2)

## Files in this Design Iteration

- **DESIGN_CONSTRAINTS.md** - Core design requirements and definitions
- **CORE_CLASS_DIAGRAM.md** - Complete framework class architecture and relationships
- **SEQUENCE_DIAGRAMS.md** - Runtime execution flows and component interactions

## Next Steps

Ready for collaborative design iteration to define:
1. Core class hierarchy and interfaces
2. Process execution engine architecture  
3. Resource management framework
4. Human-AI collaboration patterns
5. Exception handling and governance integration
