# BUSY System Architecture Overview

**Last Updated**: July 2025  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Scope**: Complete BUSY ecosystem architecture

## Executive Summary

The BUSY ecosystem transforms business process definitions into executable organizational systems through a comprehensive architecture built on layer-first design principles. The system consists of four primary components working together to enable business processes as code.

## System Components

### 1. BUSY Language - Domain-Specific Language
**Purpose**: Human-readable DSL for describing business processes  
**Format**: YAML-based with strict schema validation  
**Key Features**:
- Layer-first architecture (L0 Operational, L1 Management, L2 Strategic)
- Team definitions with roles and playbooks
- Process interfaces and resource management
- Version control integration with git workflow
- Namespace structure mapping to file organization

### 2. BUSY Compiler - Translation Engine  
**Purpose**: Transform .busy files into executable components  
**Pipeline Stages**:
```
Source Files (.busy) â†’ Tokenizer/Lexer â†’ Parser (AST) â†’ 
Semantic Analyzer â†’ Dependency Resolution â†’ IR â†’ 
Code Generation â†’ Output Artifacts
```
**Output Targets**:
- React/TypeScript applications
- Database schemas with runtime state
- AI agent configurations
- Integration specifications

### 3. Orgata Runtime - Process Execution Engine
**Purpose**: Execute compiled business processes with human-AI collaboration  
**Core Capabilities**:
- Web-based UI for human interactions
- AI agent orchestration and context assembly
- Exception handling with process state freezing
- Audit trails and state management
- Client folder system for human-readable artifacts

### 4. OSTEAOS - Business Operating System
**Purpose**: System integrity, isolation, and governance  
**Functions**:
- Runtime isolation between organizational layers
- Inter-runtime communication and negotiation
- Resource allocation and management
- Security and governance enforcement
- System-wide monitoring and health checks

## Layer-First Architecture

The fundamental design principle organizing all system components:

### L0 - Operational Layer
- **Focus**: Day-to-day business operations
- **Scope**: Direct customer interaction, product delivery
- **Example Teams**: Client operations, creative production
- **Runtime**: Isolated Orgata instance with operational tools

### L1 - Management Layer  
- **Focus**: Process optimization and resource coordination
- **Scope**: Cross-team coordination, efficiency improvement
- **Example Teams**: Process optimization, quality assurance
- **Runtime**: Separate Orgata instance with management interfaces

### L2 - Strategic Layer
- **Focus**: Long-term planning and organizational design
- **Scope**: Business strategy, organizational structure
- **Example Teams**: Executive, strategic planning  
- **Runtime**: Dedicated Orgata instance with strategic tools

### Inter-Layer Communication
- **API Model**: Explicit interfaces with defined contracts
- **Message Passing**: Structured communication via OSTEAOS
- **Isolation Enforcement**: Runtime boundaries prevent layer mixing
- **Escalation Paths**: Exception handling across layer boundaries

## Data Flow Architecture

### Compilation Flow
```
1. Source Analysis: .busy files â†’ AST â†’ Dependency Graph
2. Validation Phase: Type Checking â†’ Constraint Verification â†’ Conflict Detection  
3. Code Generation: Runtime Config â†’ UI Specs â†’ AI Configs â†’ Integration Specs
4. Deployment: Orgata Configuration â†’ OSTEAOS Resource Allocation
```

### Runtime Execution Flow
```
1. Process Initiation: Trigger Event â†’ Resource Request â†’ Runtime Allocation
2. Execution: Step Processing â†’ Interface Generation â†’ Human/AI Interaction
3. Exception Handling: Issue Detection â†’ State Freeze â†’ Resolution Path â†’ Process Resume
4. Completion: Deliverable Validation â†’ Audit Logging â†’ Resource Release
```

## Runtime Architecture Details

### Human-Readable Artifacts
**Philosophy**: Generate both code and data that users can understand and manipulate

**Client Folder System**:
```
clients/{client-id}-{client-name}/
â”œâ”€â”€ process-log.md           # Human-readable audit trail
â”œâ”€â”€ documents/               # Process documents and deliverables
â”œâ”€â”€ communications/          # Client communication history
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.json           # Machine-readable process state
â””â”€â”€ assets/                 # Process-specific media and files
```

### Task Execution Models

**Human Tasks**: Form-based interfaces with validation
- Generated UI components from BUSY task definitions
- Type-safe input/output handling
- Context display from previous process steps
- Integrated audit trail and state management

**Algorithmic Tasks**: Function stubs with clear integration points  
- Type-safe interfaces generated from BUSY specifications
- Mock implementations for development and testing
- Configuration hooks for runtime behavior
- External service integration points

**AI Agent Tasks**: Prompt templates with LLM integration
- Generated prompts based on task descriptions
- Context assembly from process state
- Result parsing and validation
- Fallback to human review when needed

## Code Generation and Evolution

### Regeneration Strategy
**Challenge**: Preserve user customizations while updating generated code  
**Solution**: Git-based workflow with AI-assisted merging

**Process**:
1. Create feature branch for BUSY updates
2. Generate fresh code in isolated build directory
3. AI-assisted diff analysis and smart merging
4. Standard pull request workflow for human review
5. Merge approved changes to maintain consistency

**Merge Categories**:
- **BUSY-Driven Changes**: Must take precedence (schema updates, task changes)
- **User Customizations**: Preserve when possible (UI styling, additional validation)
- **Conflicts**: Require human resolution (incompatible changes)
