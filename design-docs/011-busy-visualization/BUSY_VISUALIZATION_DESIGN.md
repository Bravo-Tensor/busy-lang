# BUSY File Visualization System Design

## Overview

This document specifies a comprehensive visualization system for BUSY files that enables users to understand complex business organizations through interactive visual representations. The system will visualize playbooks, roles, their relationships, and dependencies to provide clear insights into organizational structure and workflow interactions.

## Problem Statement

As BUSY organizations grow in complexity, understanding the relationships between:
- Playbooks and their constituent roles
- Role dependencies and interactions  
- Resource flows and constraints
- Organizational hierarchy and structure
- Cross-playbook dependencies

becomes increasingly difficult when working with raw YAML files. A visual representation system is needed to make these complex relationships comprehensible at a glance.

## Design Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Relationship Visualization**: Clear representation of how playbooks, roles, and resources interact
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Visual dependency graphs showing both direct and transitive dependencies
3. **Interactive Exploration**: Allow users to drill down from high-level organizational views to specific implementation details
4. **Real-time Analysis**: Dynamic visualization that updates as BUSY files are modified
5. **Multi-perspective Views**: Different visualization modes for different user needs (strategic, operational, technical)

### Secondary Goals
1. **Export Capabilities**: Generate static diagrams for documentation and presentations
2. **Collaboration Features**: Share and annotate visualizations
3. **Performance Optimization**: Handle large organizational structures efficiently
4. **Integration Ready**: Designed for integration with Orgata IDE and other tools

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. BUSY Parser Integration
- Leverage existing compiler infrastructure
- Extract structural information from parsed AST
- Maintain real-time synchronization with file changes
- Support for partial parsing and incremental updates

#### 2. Graph Model Builder
```typescript
interface VisualizationGraph {
  nodes: VisualizationNode[]
  edges: VisualizationEdge[]
  metadata: GraphMetadata
}

interface VisualizationNode {
  id: string
  type: 'playbook' | 'role' | 'resource' | 'constraint' | 'organization'
  label: string
  data: BusyEntity
  position?: Point2D
  style?: NodeStyle
}

interface VisualizationEdge {
  id: string
  source: string
  target: string
  type: 'dependency' | 'composition' | 'resource-flow' | 'hierarchy'
  metadata: EdgeMetadata
  style?: EdgeStyle
}
```

#### 3. Layout Engine
- **Hierarchical Layout**: For organizational structures and playbook decomposition
- **Force-Directed Layout**: For dependency relationships and role interactions
- **Layered Layout**: For resource flows and process sequences
- **Custom Algorithms**: Business-specific layouts optimized for BUSY structures

#### 4. Rendering Engine
- SVG-based rendering for scalability and export
- Canvas fallback for performance with large graphs
- WebGL acceleration for complex visualizations
- Progressive rendering for large datasets

#### 5. Interaction Controller
- Pan, zoom, and selection interactions
- Node/edge filtering and highlighting
- Detail panels and contextual information
- Multi-select and batch operations

### Visualization Types

#### 1. Organizational Overview
**Purpose**: High-level view of the entire business organization
**Elements**:
- Organization as root node
- Playbooks as primary children
- High-level resource flows
- Strategic objectives and constraints

**Layout**: Hierarchical tree with organizational layers clearly delineated

#### 2. Playbook Detail View
**Purpose**: Detailed view of a specific playbook and its roles
**Elements**:
- Playbook as central node
- Roles as connected nodes
- Role dependencies and interactions
- Resource requirements and flows
- Timing constraints and sequences

**Layout**: Hybrid layout combining hierarchy (for role structure) and force-direction (for dependencies)

#### 3. Role Interaction Map
**Purpose**: Focus on how roles interact across playbooks
**Elements**:
- Roles as primary nodes
- Cross-playbook dependencies
- Shared resource usage
- Communication patterns
- Conflict detection

**Layout**: Force-directed with clustering by playbook affiliation

#### 4. Resource Flow Diagram
**Purpose**: Visualize how resources move through the organization
**Elements**:
- Resources as flowing entities
- Roles as processors/consumers
- Resource constraints and bottlenecks
- Capacity and utilization metrics

**Layout**: Layered/Sankey-style flow diagram

#### 5. Dependency Graph
**Purpose**: Pure dependency visualization
**Elements**:
- All entities as nodes
- Dependency relationships as directed edges
- Circular dependency detection
- Critical path highlighting

**Layout**: Directed acyclic graph (DAG) layout with cycle detection

  optimizeForRendering(graph: PositionedGraph): OptimizedGraph
}
```

  renderToCanvas(graph: OptimizedGraph, context: CanvasContext): void
  exportToImage(graph: OptimizedGraph, format: 'png' | 'svg' | 'pdf'): Blob
}
```

### Visual Design System

#### Node Styling
```typescript
interface NodeStyle {
  // Shape and size
  shape: 'rectangle' | 'circle' | 'diamond' | 'hexagon'
  width: number
  height: number
  
  // Colors and appearance
  fillColor: string
  strokeColor: string
  strokeWidth: number
  
  // Typography
  textColor: string
  fontSize: number
  fontWeight: 'normal' | 'bold'
  
  // Interactive states
  hoverStyle?: Partial<NodeStyle>
  selectedStyle?: Partial<NodeStyle>
  
  // Semantic indicators
  statusIndicator?: StatusIndicator
  badges?: Badge[]
}

interface StatusIndicator {
  type: 'error' | 'warning' | 'success' | 'info'
  position: 'top-right' | 'top-left' | 'bottom-right' | 'bottom-left'
}
```

  warning: '#f59e0b',         // Amber
} as const
```

### Performance Considerations

#### Large Graph Handling
- **Virtualization**: Only render visible nodes/edges
- **Level-of-Detail**: Simplified rendering at high zoom levels
- **Clustering**: Group related nodes when zoomed out
- **Progressive Loading**: Load graph data incrementally

#### Memory Management
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse rendering objects
- **Garbage Collection**: Explicit cleanup of unused elements
- **Caching**: Cache rendered elements and layouts
- **Lazy Loading**: Load detailed data on demand

#### Update Strategies
- **Incremental Updates**: Only re-render changed elements
- **Batched Updates**: Group multiple changes together
- **Animation Optimization**: Use requestAnimationFrame
- **Background Processing**: Use Web Workers for heavy computations

## Integration Points

### Compiler Integration
```typescript
interface CompilerIntegration {
  // Listen for file changes
  onFileChanged(file: BusyFile, changes: FileChange[]): void
  
  // Request parsing results
  getParseResults(files: BusyFile[]): Promise<ParseResult[]>
  
  // Subscribe to compilation events
  onCompilationComplete(callback: (results: CompilationResult[]) => void): void
}
```

### Orgata IDE Integration
```typescript
interface OrgataIntegration {
  // Embed visualization in IDE
  createVisualizationPanel(container: HTMLElement): VisualizationPanel
  
  // Sync with editor selection
  onEditorSelectionChange(selection: EditorSelection): void
  
  // Navigate to source
  onNodeDoubleClick(node: VisualizationNode): void
}
```

### Export Integration
```typescript
interface ExportIntegration {
  // Export to various formats
  exportToPNG(options: ExportOptions): Promise<Blob>
  exportToSVG(options: ExportOptions): Promise<string>
  exportToPDF(options: ExportOptions): Promise<Blob>
  
  // Documentation integration
  generateDocumentation(template: DocumentationTemplate): Promise<string>
}
```
