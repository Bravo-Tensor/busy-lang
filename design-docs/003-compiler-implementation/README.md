# 003: Compiler Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Type**: Implementation Plan  

## Overview

This design iteration defines the complete implementation plan for the BUSY language compiler, including technology stack, project structure, implementation phases, and analysis rules. The compiler transforms BUSY language files into validated, executable components.

## Design Focus

- **TypeScript/Node.js Implementation**: Chosen for ecosystem compatibility and developer experience
- **Comprehensive Analysis Engine**: Static analysis, type checking, and validation rules
- **Multi-Phase Implementation**: Structured development approach with clear deliverables
- **Performance Targets**: Scalability goals for different repository sizes

## Impact Assessment

**Scope**: Complete compiler toolchain for BUSY language  
**Breaking Changes**: None (implements existing language specification)  
**Migration Required**: None (new implementation)

## Success Criteria

- [x] Complete YAML parsing with position tracking
- [x] Symbol table and type system implementation
- [x] Interface coherence validation engine
- [x] Dead code detection and workflow analysis
- [x] CLI tooling with multiple output formats
- [x] Performance targets met for repository analysis

## Key Technical Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **TypeScript/Node.js**: Core language for implementation
- **YAML + JSON Schema**: Parsing and validation foundation
- **AST + Symbol Table**: Semantic analysis infrastructure
- **CLI Framework**: Command-line interface with multiple reporters

### Analysis Engine
Comprehensive static analysis including:
- **Interface Coherence**: Deliverable input/output matching
- **Dead Code Detection**: Unused roles and playbook identification
- **Dependency Analysis**: Circular dependency detection and resolution
- **Resource Validation**: Capacity and allocation verification

### Performance Targets
- Small repos (1-10 files): <100ms analysis time
- Medium repos (10-100 files): <1s analysis time
- Large repos (100-1000 files): <10s analysis time
- Memory usage: <1GB for largest expected repositories

## Implementation Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Completed)
- Project setup with TypeScript tooling
- YAML parser with position tracking
- Basic AST node definitions and file discovery
- Simple CLI with validate command

### ✅ Phase 2: Symbol Table and Type System (Completed)
- Symbol table implementation with cross-file references
- Type definition system for deliverables
- Import resolution for tools and advisors
- Role inheritance resolution

### ✅ Phase 3: Interface Analysis (Completed)
- Deliverable input/output matching validation
- Interface completeness checking
- Data flow analysis and schema compatibility
- Resource allocation validation

### ✅ Phase 4: Dead Code and Workflow Analysis (Completed)
- Dead code detection for unused entities
- Workflow reachability analysis
- Entry point validation
- Dependency graph generation and visualization

### ✅ Phase 5: Advanced Features (Completed)
- Performance optimization analysis
- HTML report generation
- Watch mode for development workflow
- Integration with generated runtime applications

## Architecture Implementation

### CLI Command Structure
```typescript
busy-check validate [path] [options]
busy-check analyze [path] [options]  
busy-check generate-runtime [path] [options]
busy-check watch [path] [options]
```

### Analysis Rules Engine
Modular analysis system with:
- **InterfaceAnalyzer**: Type compatibility validation
- **DeadCodeAnalyzer**: Unused entity detection  
- **WorkflowAnalyzer**: Process completeness validation
- **DependencyAnalyzer**: Circular dependency detection

### Error Reporting System
Comprehensive error classification:
- **Syntax Errors**: YAML parsing and schema validation
- **Type Errors**: Interface compatibility issues
- **Logic Errors**: Dead code and workflow problems
- **Resource Errors**: Capacity and allocation issues

## Integration Points

### Runtime Generation
The compiler generates complete React/TypeScript applications:
- Database schema with BUSY entity definitions
- React components for UI interfaces
- TypeScript services for business logic
- API endpoints for process execution

### Development Workflow
Integration with standard development practices:
- Git-based version control workflow
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- IDE language server protocol support
- NPM package distribution

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Unit Tests**: Individual analyzer components and AST operations
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end compilation pipeline testing
- **E2E Tests**: CLI command execution and real repository analysis
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking against scalability targets

### Test Data Organization
```
tests/fixtures/
├── valid-repos/           # Valid BUSY repositories
├── invalid-repos/         # Repositories with known issues  
└── edge-cases/            # Corner cases and edge scenarios
```

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode enforcement
- ESLint/Prettier for code formatting
- Jest for comprehensive testing coverage
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Validation Coverage
- All grammar elements validated with JSON Schema
- All analysis rules tested with positive/negative cases
- Error messages tested for clarity and actionability
- Performance regression testing

## Distribution and Deployment

### NPM Package Distribution
```json
{
  "name": "@busy-lang/compiler",
  "bin": {
    "busy-check": "./dist/cli/index.js"
  },
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts"
}
```

### CI/CD Integration
GitHub Actions workflow for BUSY validation in repositories.

## Historical Context

This implementation plan guided the development of the complete BUSY compiler toolchain. The phased approach enabled incremental development while maintaining comprehensive test coverage and performance targets throughout the implementation process.

The compiler became the foundation for the entire BUSY ecosystem, enabling both static analysis of BUSY specifications and dynamic generation of executable runtime applications.
