# 001: Initial BUSY Language Specification

**Date**: 2024-2025  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Type**: Core Language Design  

## Overview

This design iteration establishes the foundational BUSY language specification, including core grammar, architecture concepts, and product requirements. This represents the initial design work that created the BUSY ecosystem.

## Design Focus

- **Core Language Grammar**: YAML-based DSL syntax and structure
- **Business Domain Concepts**: Teams, roles, playbooks, tasks, deliverables
- **Product Requirements**: Solo business operator focus and use cases
- **Architecture Foundation**: Layer-first design principles

## Impact Assessment

**Scope**: Foundation for entire BUSY ecosystem  
**Breaking Changes**: None (initial design)  
**Migration Required**: None (initial implementation)

## Success Criteria

- [x] Complete grammar specification for BUSY language
- [x] Comprehensive product requirements documentation  
- [x] Architecture framework supporting business process modeling
- [x] Example business implementation (solo photography business)

## Files in this Design Iteration

- **BUSY_LANGUAGE_SPECIFICATION.md** - Complete grammar and language definition
- **GRAMMAR_SPECIFICATION.md** - Formal syntax and parsing rules
- **PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md** - Business requirements and use cases

## Implementation Notes

This design iteration established the core concepts that enable business processes to be described as code. The layer-first architecture (L0/L1/L2) and the separation between roles and playbooks became fundamental organizing principles for the entire system.

## Historical Context

This represents the foundational design work completed during the initial BUSY language development. All subsequent design iterations build upon the concepts established in this specification.
