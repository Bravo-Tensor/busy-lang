# Conversational Interface Design

## Overview

The Orgata IDE conversational interface enables natural language business process design and management. Unlike traditional chatbots, this system maintains deep business context and can generate, modify, and execute BUSY language processes through conversation.

## Conversation Patterns

### 1. Business Discovery & Initial Setup

**Pattern**: Structured interview to understand business domain and create initial BUSY files

```
AI: "I'll help you set up your business processes. What type of business are you running?"

User: "I'm starting a consulting practice focused on digital transformation"

AI: "Great! Digital transformation consulting typically involves client discovery, 
     proposal development, project execution, and knowledge transfer. Let me ask 
     some questions to customize this for your practice:
     
     1. What's your typical project duration?
     2. Do you work with teams or solo?
     3. What deliverables do you usually provide?"

User: "Projects are usually 3-6 months, I work with a small team of 3 people, 
       and we deliver strategy documents, implementation roadmaps, and training."

AI: "Perfect! I'm creating your business processes now...
     
     ‚úÖ Created: L0/client-operations/team.busy (3 consultants)
     ‚úÖ Created: L0/project-delivery/playbooks/discovery-phase.busy
     ‚úÖ Created: L0/project-delivery/playbooks/strategy-development.busy
     ‚úÖ Created: L0/project-delivery/playbooks/implementation-planning.busy
     ‚úÖ Created: L0/knowledge-management/playbooks/training-delivery.busy
     
     Would you like to review the client onboarding process first?"
```

### 2. Process Modification During Execution

**Pattern**: Real-time process adjustment based on operational feedback

```
User: "The discovery phase is taking too long. Clients are getting impatient."

AI: "I can help optimize that. Let me check your current discovery process...
     
     üìä Analysis: Your discovery phase averages 4 weeks vs industry standard 2 weeks
     üîç Bottleneck identified: Stakeholder interviews (currently sequential)
     
     I can modify the process to run interviews in parallel and add a quick
     initial assessment. This would affect:
     
     ‚Ä¢ discovery-phase.busy (main process)
     ‚Ä¢ stakeholder-interview.busy (timing changes)
     ‚Ä¢ project-timeline.busy (overall schedule update)
     
     Shall I implement these changes?"

User: "Yes, but make sure we don't lose quality"

AI: "Absolutely. I'll add quality checkpoints...
     
     üîÑ Modifying discovery-phase.busy...
     ‚úÖ Added parallel interview scheduling
     ‚úÖ Added 2-day quick assessment step
     ‚úÖ Added quality gate after interviews
     ‚úÖ Updated timeline: 4 weeks ‚Üí 2.5 weeks
     
     Knit detected 3 dependent processes need updates:
     ‚Ä¢ project-timeline.busy ‚úÖ Auto-updated
     ‚Ä¢ resource-allocation.busy ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs review (capacity conflict)
     ‚Ä¢ client-communication.busy ‚úÖ Auto-updated
     
     The resource allocation needs your input - should I schedule this change
     for review with your team?"
```

### 3. Performance Analysis & Optimization

**Pattern**: Proactive insights and improvement suggestions

```
AI: "I've been analyzing your business performance and noticed something interesting.
     Your project completion rate is 95%, but client satisfaction drops after month 4.
     
     üìà Data insights:
     ‚Ä¢ Projects under 4 months: 9.2/10 satisfaction
     ‚Ä¢ Projects over 4 months: 7.1/10 satisfaction
     ‚Ä¢ Common issue: Communication frequency decreases
     
     I can suggest some process improvements. Would you like to see them?"

User: "Yes, what do you recommend?"

AI: "I recommend adding structured check-ins and milestone celebrations:
     
     1. Add weekly client touchpoints after month 3
     2. Create milestone celebration rituals
     3. Implement early warning system for scope creep
     
     These changes would modify:
     ‚Ä¢ client-communication.busy (add touchpoint schedule)
     ‚Ä¢ project-monitoring.busy (add milestone tracking)
     ‚Ä¢ scope-management.busy (add early warning triggers)
     
     Based on similar businesses, this typically improves long-project satisfaction
     from 7.1 to 8.7. Shall I implement these changes?"
```

## Conversation Engine Architecture

### Intent Classification

```typescript
interface ConversationIntent {
  type: 'discovery' | 'modification' | 'analysis' | 'execution' | 'help';
  confidence: number;
  entities: ExtractedEntity[];
  businessContext: BusinessContext;
}

interface ExtractedEntity {
  type: 'process' | 'role' | 'timeline' | 'resource' | 'metric';
  value: string;
  busyFileReference?: string;
}

class IntentClassifier {
  classifyIntent(userInput: string, context: ConversationContext): ConversationIntent {
    // Use fine-tuned LLM for business process domain
    // Extract business entities (processes, roles, resources)
    // Map to BUSY language concepts
    // Return structured intent with confidence score
  }
}
```

### Context Management

```typescript
interface BusinessContext {
  industry: string;
  businessSize: 'solo' | 'small' | 'medium' | 'enterprise';
  currentProcesses: Map<string, BusyProcess>;
  executionMetrics: ProcessMetrics[];
  recentModifications: ModificationHistory[];
  userRole: UserRole;
  conversationGoals: string[];
}

class ContextManager {
  private context: BusinessContext;
  private conversationMemory: ConversationTurn[];
  
  updateContext(userInput: string, aiAction: AIAction): void {
    // Update business understanding
    // Track conversation flow
    // Maintain process knowledge
    // Remember user preferences
  }
  
  getRelevantContext(intent: ConversationIntent): ContextualInformation {
    // Return relevant business processes
    // Include recent execution data
    // Add historical modification context
    // Suggest related improvements
  }
}
```

### Response Generation

```typescript
interface AIResponse {
  message: string;
  proposedActions: BusyFileModification[];
  knitAnalysis?: KnitImpactAnalysis;
  confidenceLevel: number;
  requiresApproval: boolean;
  visualizations?: ProcessVisualization[];
}

class ResponseGenerator {
  generateResponse(
    intent: ConversationIntent,
    context: BusinessContext,
    knitAnalysis: KnitImpactAnalysis
  ): AIResponse {
    // Generate natural language explanation
    // Propose specific BUSY file changes
    // Include impact analysis from knit
    // Add visualizations if helpful
    // Determine if approval needed
  }
}
```

## Business Process Interview Framework

### Discovery Question Templates

```typescript
interface InterviewTemplate {
  industry: string;
  questions: DiscoveryQuestion[];
  followUpLogic: QuestionFlow;
  busyTemplates: BusyProcessTemplate[];
}

interface DiscoveryQuestion {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  type: 'open' | 'choice' | 'scale' | 'priority';
  options?: string[];
  dependsOn?: string[];
  mapsTo: BusyElementMapping;
}

// Example: Photography Business Interview
const photographyInterview: InterviewTemplate = {
  industry: 'photography',
  questions: [
    {
      id: 'business_type',
      text: 'What type of photography do you specialize in?',
      type: 'choice',
      options: ['wedding', 'portrait', 'commercial', 'event', 'landscape'],
      mapsTo: { busyElement: 'business-domain', attribute: 'specialization' }
    },
    {
      id: 'team_size',
      text: 'How many people work with you regularly?',
      type: 'open',
      mapsTo: { busyElement: 'team', attribute: 'size' }
    },
    {
      id: 'booking_process',
      text: 'How do clients typically book with you?',
      type: 'open',
      dependsOn: ['business_type'],
      mapsTo: { busyElement: 'client-onboarding', attribute: 'entry-point' }
    }
  ],
  followUpLogic: {
    'business_type:wedding': ['venue_requirements', 'equipment_needs'],
    'team_size:>1': ['role_definition', 'task_assignment']
  },
  busyTemplates: [
    'photography-business-base.busy',
    'client-operations.busy',
    'creative-production.busy'
  ]
};
```

### Template-Based BUSY Generation

```typescript
class BusyGenerator {
  generateFromInterview(
    answers: InterviewAnswers,
    template: InterviewTemplate
  ): GeneratedBusyFiles {
    // Map answers to BUSY concepts
    // Select appropriate templates
    // Customize based on specific answers
    // Generate complete file structure
    // Validate business logic
    // Return ready-to-run BUSY files
  }
}
```

## Natural Language Understanding

### Business Domain Language Model

```typescript
interface BusinessNLU {
  extractProcessSteps(description: string): ProcessStep[];
  identifyRoles(description: string): BusinessRole[];
  extractTimelines(description: string): Timeline[];
  recognizeResources(description: string): Resource[];
  detectDependencies(description: string): Dependency[];
}

// Example: Process step extraction
const extractedSteps = businessNLU.extractProcessSteps(
  "First we schedule a consultation call, then send a proposal, 
   and after they sign we collect a deposit and schedule the shoot"
);
// Returns: [
//   { action: 'schedule', object: 'consultation-call', timing: 'first' },
//   { action: 'send', object: 'proposal', timing: 'after-consultation' },
//   { action: 'collect', object: 'deposit', timing: 'after-signing' },
//   { action: 'schedule', object: 'shoot', timing: 'after-deposit' }
// ]
```

### Modification Intent Recognition

```typescript
interface ModificationIntent {
  type: 'add' | 'remove' | 'modify' | 'optimize' | 'reorder';
  target: ProcessElement;
  change: ChangeDescription;
  urgency: 'immediate' | 'next-cycle' | 'planned';
}

// Example modification intents:
const examples = [
  {
    input: "The client approval step is taking too long",
    intent: {
      type: 'optimize',
      target: { process: 'client-approval', step: 'review-cycle' },
      change: { aspect: 'duration', direction: 'reduce' },
      urgency: 'immediate'
    }
  },
  {
    input: "Add a quality check before we send deliverables",
    intent: {
      type: 'add',
      target: { process: 'deliverable-workflow', position: 'before-send' },
      change: { action: 'quality-check', role: 'senior-consultant' },
      urgency: 'next-cycle'
    }
  }
];
```

## User Experience Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure

1. **High-Level Summary**: Start with business impact
2. **Process Details**: Show specific BUSY changes
3. **Technical Details**: Display knit reconciliation analysis
4. **Implementation**: Execute changes with monitoring

### Approval Workflows

```typescript
interface ApprovalWorkflow {
  changes: BusyFileModification[];
  impactLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  requiredApprovers: UserRole[];
  autoApproveThreshold: number;
  escalationPath: ApprovalPath[];
}

// Example: High-impact changes require team review
const workflowRules = {
  'high': {
    requiredApprovers: ['business-owner', 'process-manager'],
    autoApproveThreshold: 0.95,
    escalationPath: ['immediate-notification', 'schedule-review-meeting']
  },
  'low': {
    requiredApprovers: [],
    autoApproveThreshold: 0.80,
    escalationPath: ['notification-only']
  }
};
```

### Error Handling & Recovery

```typescript
interface ConversationError {
  type: 'misunderstanding' | 'invalid-request' | 'system-error';
  userInput: string;
  suggestedFixes: string[];
  fallbackActions: Action[];
}

class ErrorHandler {
  handleMisunderstanding(userInput: string): ConversationError {
    return {
      type: 'misunderstanding',
      userInput,
      suggestedFixes: [
        "Could you be more specific about which process you want to modify?",
        "Are you referring to the client onboarding or project delivery process?",
        "Would you like me to show you the current process first?"
      ],
      fallbackActions: [
        { type: 'show-process-list' },
        { type: 'provide-examples' }
      ]
    };
  }
}
```

This conversational interface design creates an intuitive, powerful way for business owners to manage their operations through natural language, backed by the rigor of BUSY language processes and knit dependency management.
