# Orgata Runtime Service - Implementation Plan

**Created**: July 2025  
**Status**: Design Phase  
**Timeline**: 12 months  
**Dependencies**: Orgata Framework (completed)

## Overview

Implementation plan for building the Orgata Runtime Service as a team-based, multi-interface platform for business process management. This service will serve as the central source of truth with git-like workflows and intelligent AI assistance.

## Implementation Strategy

### Core Principles
1. **API-First Development**: Design APIs before implementing features
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive testing at all layers
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Working software every 2-4 weeks
4. **Interface Parity**: Ensure all three interfaces (UI, MCP, API) provide equivalent functionality
5. **Security by Design**: Build security and compliance from the ground up
